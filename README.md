# Data_Profession_Breakdown
In this project we perform exploratory data analysis on data collected from different data professionals and we visualise the insights making use of PowerBi.
Please downlaod the Data_Profession_Breakdown.pdf to view dashboard as Github is unable to render the rich display.

# Objective:
The primary objective is to conduct a comprehensive EDA on the dataset compiled from diverse data professionals, unraveling trends, correlations, and key metrics.

# Process:
Through rigorous EDA techniques, the dataset undergoes analysis to uncover meaningful insights and understand the characteristics of the data.
The insights and patterns discovered are then visualized using Power BI, facilitating the creation of interactive and visually engaging dashboards.

# Contents:
This repository contains the Data_Profession_Breakdown.pdf file, showcasing the Power BI dashboard presenting the visualized insights derived from the data professionals' dataset.
Additionally, the code and documentation used for the EDA and visualization process are available for reference and reproduction.

# Usage:
The provided Power BI dashboard serves as a rich visual representation of the data professionals' breakdown, offering interactive visualizations for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
The code and documentation can be utilized as a guide for performing similar EDA tasks or creating visualizations using Power BI.
